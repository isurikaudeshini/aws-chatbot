Blue/Green Deployments are ideal for use cases such as major or minor version database engine upgrades, operating system updates, schema changes on green environments that do not break logical replication, like adding a new column at the end of a table, or database parameter setting changes. You can use Blue/Green Deployments to make multiple database updates at the same time using a single switchover. This allows you to stay current on security patches, improve database performance, and access newer database features with short, predictable downtime. \n",

      "Pattern: Do I need to enable automatic backups on my DB instance before I can create read replicas? \n",
      "Response: Yes. Enable automatic backups on your source DB Instance before adding read replicas by setting the backup retention period to a value other than 0. Backups must remain enabled for read replicas to work. \n",
      "Pattern: I need to launch instances quickly without any upfront commitments. What EC2 option should I choose? \n",
      "Response: On-Demand Instances provide the flexibility to launch instances quickly without any upfront commitments. They are suitable for applications with variable workloads.\n",

      "Response: No, AWS prohibits the resale of RIs purchased as part of a discount program per AWS Service Terms.

      "Response: Trn1 instances are a good fit for your natural language processing (NLP), large language model (LLM), and computer vision (CV) model training use cases. Trn1 instances focus on accelerating model training to deliver high performance while also lowering your model training costs. If you have ML models that need third-party proprietary libraries or languages, for example NVIDIA CUDA, CUDA Deep Neural Network (cuDNN), or TensorRT libraries, we recommend using the NVIDIA GPU-based instances (P4, P3).\n",

Lambda functions being invoked asynchronously can absorb reasonable bursts of traffic for approximately 15-30 minutes, after which incoming events will be rejected as throttled. In case the Lambda function is being invoked in response to Amazon S3 events, events rejected by AWS Lambda may be retained and retried by S3 for 24 hours. Events from Amazon Kinesis streams and Amazon DynamoDB streams are retried until the Lambda function succeeds or the data expires. Amazon Kinesis and Amazon DynamoDB Streams retain data for 24 hours. \n",

      "Pattern: Will AMIs that I used on P3 and P3dn work on P4? \n",
      "Response: The P4 AMIs will need new NVIDIA drivers for the A100 GPUs and a newer version of the ENA driver installed. P4 instances are powered by Nitro System and they require AMIs with NVMe and ENA driver installed. P4 also comes with new Intel Cascade Lake CPUs, which come with an updated instruction set, so we recommend using the latest distributions of ML frameworks, which take advantage of these new instruction sets for data pre-processing.\n",
      "Pattern: Why should I use EFA? \n",
      "Response: EFA brings the scalability, flexibility, and elasticity of cloud to tightly coupled HPC applications. With EFA, tightly coupled HPC applications have access to lower and more consistent latency and higher throughput than traditional TCP channels, enabling them to scale better. EFA support can be enabled dynamically, on-demand on any supported EC2 instance without pre-reservation, giving you the flexibility to respond to changing business/workload priorities.\n",

      "Pattern: When running my DB instance as a Multi-AZ deployment, can I use the standby for read or write operations? \n",
      "Response: No, a Multi-AZ standby cannot serve read requests. Multi-AZ deployments are designed to provide enhanced database availability and durability, rather than read scaling benefits. As such, the feature uses synchronous replication between primary and standby. Our implementation makes sure the primary and the standby are constantly in sync, but precludes using the standby for read or write operations.
